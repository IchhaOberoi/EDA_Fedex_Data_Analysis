# Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing a logistics dataset to derive insights aimed at optimizing the companyâ€™s shipping operations, improving delivery performance, and managing freight costs effectively.

Through statistical analysis and visualizations, key insights were uncovered, including the significant relationship between shipment modes and on-time delivery performance. Air shipments, though more expensive, demonstrated the highest on-time delivery rates, making it ideal for time-sensitive deliveries. In contrast, sea freight, while cheaper, had higher delays.

The analysis also found a positive correlation between freight costs and on-time delivery, suggesting that investing in faster shipping methods may improve reliability, though at a higher cost. Further, the project revealed that vendor performance plays a critical role in delivery timeliness, emphasizing the need for strategic partnerships with reliable vendors. Additionally, the correlation between shipment weight and insurance costs was highlighted, indicating that heavier shipments tend to incur higher costs.

# Problem Statement

The problem statement for this analysis is to explore FedEx's shipment data to identify key factors influencing on-time delivery performance, analyze the relationship between shipment modes and freight costs, and uncover patterns that can help optimize logistics operations. The goal is to provide actionable insights for improving operational efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing customer satisfaction.
